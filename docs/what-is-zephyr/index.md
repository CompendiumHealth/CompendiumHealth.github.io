# What is Zephyr Health?

Zephyr Health is a booking platform which enables consumers to see precise price comparisons and scheduling availabilities for diagnostic testing in your area. We’re building a one-stop shop where consumers can take healthcare into their own hands.

Our guiding principle is that healthcare shouldn’t be opaque. People should be empowered to make informed healthcare decisions based on concrete factors such as quality, availability, and price, but this information isn’t made readily available. When we buy products from Amazon, we read past user reviews, we can see whether the product is in-stock, and we sometimes compare prices. But then when we're stuck on a phone during our lunch break trying to coordinate scheduling a healthcare appointment, we're stuck trying to even figure out if we can find _any_ appointments in the next few months. 

American patients today remain in the dark about their quality of care, struggle to schedule necessary appointments, and dread receiving exorbitant medical bills after their appointment. The healthcare referral and intake process is held to a different, lower standard, and we believe it is time to level the playing field.
