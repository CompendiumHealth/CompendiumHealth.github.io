# How does Compendium Health make money?

Consumers don't have to pay anything to browse or make appointments on our platform! It's win-win: we partner with self-funded health plans as a benefits plan, and additionally charge practice providers a referral fee for every new patient routed to their centers, much as Amazon charges fulfillment and referral fees.
