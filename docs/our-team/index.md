# Who are we?

Hello there!  We're [Shreyas Bhave](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shreyasabhave/) and [Tony Sun](https://www.linkedin.com/in/toekneesunshine/), two recently-defended Columbia PhD students who became close friends over the course of the PhD grind. We've worked on [research papers together](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.05174v1.pdf), competed in [nationwide healthcare-related machine learning competitions](https://www.dbmi.columbia.edu/cms-ai-team/), and even interned together as machine learning researchers at [Tempus](https://www.tempus.com/), a health-tech unicorn.

# Why are we building Zephyr Health?

Our guiding principle is that healthcare **shouldn’t** be opaque. People should be empowered to make informed healthcare decisions based on concrete factors such as quality, availability, and price, but this information isn’t readily available. American patients today remain in the dark about their quality of care, are forced to wait months to schedule an appointment, and dread receiving exorbitant medical bills after their appointment.

When you buy a product on Amazon, you can read past user reviews, see whether the product is in-stock, and compare prices. But then when you’re sitting in a hospital waiting room, you don’t really know their safety data from the past few years, you don’t know their hospital bed availability, and you definitely can’t estimate your final bill. Healthcare is held to a different, lower standard, and we believe it is time to level the playing field. 

Opacity exists to protect entrenched payer and provider interests. We’re not here to build another company that shaves money from payers or providers; we believe that the market should incentivize providers that treat their patients with respect and charge reasonable prices, and we also believe (paraphrasing the Washington Post) that efficiency dies in the dark.
